# Getting-started-with-data-analysis-with-python
This Jupyter notebook provides a step-by-step guide for data analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

The Jupyter notebook provides a step-by-step guide for data analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebook. Here's a summary of the main tasks covered:

1. **Task 1:** Setting up the Environment**
   - Install required libraries mentioned in the instructions.

2. **Task 2:** Using the pandas Python Library**
   - Download NBA data from a specified URL using the `requests` library.
   - Utilize the `pandas` library to load the data into a DataFrame and perform initial data exploration (e.g., checking data types, displaying summary statistics).

3. **Task 3:** Get to Know Your Data**
   - Explore data types and basic statistics using the `.info()` and `.describe()` functions.
   - Answer specific questions about the dataset, such as the number of wins and losses for a particular team.

4. **Task 4:** Data Access methods (loc and iloc)**
   - Demonstrate data access methods (`loc` and `iloc`) for retrieving specific rows and columns from the DataFrame.

5. **Task 5:** Querying the Dataset**
   - Filter and query the dataset based on specific conditions using boolean indexing.
   - Answer questions related to playoffs games and points scored by teams in specific years.

6. **Task 6:** Grouping and Aggregating your Data**
   - Use grouping and aggregation functions to analyze data based on specific criteria (e.g., total points scored by teams).

7. **Task 7:** Manipulating Columns**
   - Add, rename, and drop columns in the DataFrame.

8. **Task 8:** Specifying Data Types**
   - Convert data types for improved performance, such as changing date columns to datetime and categorical data type for specific columns.

9. **Task 9:** Cleaning the Data**
   - Address missing values, invalid values, and inconsistent values in the dataset.

10. **Task 10:** Data Visualization**
    - Utilize `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization, including line plots and bar plots.
    - Answer questions about team performance based on visualizations.

11. **Task 11:** Introduction to Scikit Learn**
    - Introduce the scikit-learn library for machine learning.
    - Calculate and visualize the correlation matrix.
    - Apply logistic regression for prediction and evaluate the model's accuracy.

The notebook provides a comprehensive guide for data analysis, including data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and an introduction to machine learning using logistic regression.
